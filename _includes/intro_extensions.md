All plugins can be downloaded freely on [omeka.org](https://omeka.org), [github.com](https://github.com) or [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com). Some of them are old, broken, unsupported or a work in progress. Usually, they work at least on one site. But most of them are up-to-date and useful.

__Warning__: Donâ€™t install alpha or beta version of addons on a site in production, or help the developper to finalize it.
