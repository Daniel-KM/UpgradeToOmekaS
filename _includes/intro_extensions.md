All plugins can be downloaded freely on <https://omeka.org>, <https://github.com> or <https://gitlab.com>. Some of them are old, broken, unsupported or a work in progress. Usually, they work at least on one site. But most of them are up-to-date for [Omeka Classic](https://omeka.org/classic) and useful. Some of them are listed in <https://omeka.org/addons>.

{% include stats_upgradable.md %}

Feel free to add missing plugins or modules, or to create an upgrader for the plugin [Upgrade to Omeka S](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-plugin-UpgradeToOmekaS), or an importer for the module [Omeka 2 Importer](https://github.com/omeka-s-modules/Omeka2Importer).

__Warning__: Donâ€™t install alpha or beta version of addons on a site in production, or help the developper to finalize it.
